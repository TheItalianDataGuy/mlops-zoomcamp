# MLOps Zoomcamp 2024 â€“ Coursework & Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions, homework, notes, and additional experiments related to the **MLOps Zoomcamp 2024** offered by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).

As I transition from a career in education to one in data and MLOps, this course is helping me build hands-on experience with the tools and workflows used in modern machine learning operations. 

The repo is organized week by week, following the course structure. You'll find:
- Homework submissions
- Experiment tracking examples
- Scripts for model training, deployment, and monitoring
- Personal notes and reflections

Feel free to explore or reach out if you're working through the same course!
